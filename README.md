# DEMOQA Automation with Playwright

This project demonstrates automated testing of the DEMOQA website using Playwright, created with zero coding using GitHub Copilot and Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Project Creation Steps

1. **Initial Setup**
   - Created a new project folder
   - Used GitHub Copilot to initialize the Playwright project
   - Set up the project structure using MCPs and AI assistance

2. **Project Structure**
   ```
   ├── pages/
   │   ├── BasePage.js         # Base page object with common functions
   │   └── HomePage.js         # Home page specific functions
   ├── tests/
   │   └── homepage.spec.js    # Test cases for home page
   ├── playwright.config.js    # Playwright configuration
   └── package.json           # Project dependencies
   ```

3. **Framework Setup Using AI**
   - Implemented Page Object Model pattern with AI assistance
   - Created base page class with common functions
   - Developed home page class with page-specific functions
   - Set up test configuration using Playwright best practices

4. **Test Implementation**
   The following tests were implemented using GitHub Copilot:
   - Homepage title verification
   - Elements section navigation
   - Cards visibility verification
   - Selenium training banner verification

5. **Configuration Details**
   - Set up headless mode: false (for visible test execution)
   - Configured viewport size: 1280x720
   - Enabled screenshot on failure
   - Base URL: https://demoqa.com
   - Configured HTML reporter

6. **Version Control**
   - Initialized git repository
   - Created .gitignore file for Playwright
   - Pushed code to GitHub repository

## Technologies Used
- Playwright
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- GitHub Copilot
- Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## Zero-Code Implementation
This entire project was implemented without writing code manually:
1. Used GitHub Copilot for code suggestions
2. Leveraged MCPs for project structure and best practices
3. AI-assisted test case creation and page object implementation
4. Automated configuration setup

## Running Tests
```bash
npx playwright test
```

## Test Reports
Test reports are generated in HTML format and can be found in:
- `playwright-report/index.html`

## Project Benefits
- Zero manual coding required
- Consistent implementation using best practices
- Maintainable test structure
- Page Object Model implementation
- Reusable components

## Repository Setup
1. Created new repository on GitHub
2. Configured git with email: jalarahulreddy516@gmail.com
3. Added remote repository
4. Pushed code to main branch

## Future Improvements
- Add more test scenarios
- Implement data-driven testing
- Add API testing examples
- Include visual testing capabilities
- Enhance reporting with custom attributes
