# AI-Powered DEMOQA Automation Framework

This repository contains an automated testing framework for DEMOQA website, built entirely using AI assistance through GitHub Copilot and Model Context Protocol (MCP). The project demonstrates how to create a robust test automation framework with zero manual coding.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

### 1. Project Initialization
```bash
# Created project using AI assistance
npm init playwright@latest
```
- Workspace setup completed with AI guidance
- Project structure automatically generated
- Dependencies installed through package.json

### 2. Framework Architecture
The framework follows the Page Object Model (POM) pattern, implemented using AI assistance:

```
project/
├── pages/               # Page Object classes
│   ├── BasePage.js     # Common functionality
│   └── HomePage.js     # Homepage specific actions
├── tests/              # Test specifications
│   └── homepage.spec.js # Homepage test cases
├── playwright.config.js # Test configuration
└── package.json        # Project dependencies
```

### 3. Key Components Created by AI

#### 3.1 Base Page Implementation
- Common methods for all pages
- Standardized wait conditions
- Reusable element interactions

#### 3.2 Home Page Object
- Page-specific locators
- Navigation methods
- Element verification functions

#### 3.3 Test Scenarios
Implemented test cases include:
- Homepage title verification
- Elements section navigation
- Card visibility checks
- Banner functionality testing

### 4. Configuration Setup
```javascript
// Key configurations in playwright.config.js
- Base URL: https://demoqa.com
- Browser: Chromium
- Viewport: 1280x720
- Screenshots: On failure
- Reporter: HTML
```

### 5. AI-Assisted Implementation Details

#### Commands Used:
1. Project Creation:
```bash
npm init playwright@latest
```

2. Test Execution:
```bash
npx playwright test
```

3. View Reports:
```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

#### Git Integration Steps:
1. Repository Initialization:
```bash

- ✅ Cross-browser testing capability

### 8. Running the Tests

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Node.js installed
   - npm package manager
   - Playwright browsers installed

2. **Installation:**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Running Tests:**
```bash
# Run all tests
npx playwright test

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test homepage.spec.js

# Run in headed mode
npx playwright test --headed
```

### 9. Test Reports
