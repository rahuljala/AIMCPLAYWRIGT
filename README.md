# AI-Powered DEMOQA Automation Framework

This repository contains an automated testing framework for DEMOQA website, built entirely using AI assistance through GitHub Copilot and Model Context Protocol (MCP). The project demonstrates how to create a robust test automation framework with zero manual coding.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

### 1. Project Initialization
```bash
# Created project using AI assistance
npm init playwright@latest
```
- Workspace setup completed with AI guidance
- Project structure automatically generated
- Dependencies installed through package.json

### 2. Framework Architecture
The framework follows the Page Object Model (POM) pattern, implemented using AI assistance:

```
project/
├── pages/               # Page Object classes
│   ├── BasePage.js     # Common functionality
│   └── HomePage.js     # Homepage specific actions
├── tests/              # Test specifications
│   └── homepage.spec.js # Homepage test cases
├── playwright.config.js # Test configuration
└── package.json        # Project dependencies
```

### 3. Key Components Created by AI

#### 3.1 Base Page Implementation

## Playwright CI/CD with Email HTML Report

This project is configured to run Playwright tests automatically using GitHub Actions. On test failure, the workflow will send the Playwright-generated HTML report (including screenshots if configured) as an email attachment to jalarahulreddy516@gmail.com.

### How it works
- **Smoke tests** run on every push to `main` and daily at 5 AM EST (10 AM UTC).
- **Regression tests** run every other day at 7 AM EST (12 PM UTC).
- On failure, you will receive an email with the HTML report attached.

#### To ensure screenshots are included in the report:
- In your `playwright.config.js`, set:
  ```js
  use: {
    screenshot: 'only-on-failure', // or 'on' for all tests
  }
  ```
- The HTML report will show test status and screenshots for failed tests.

#### Email setup
- The workflow uses SMTP credentials stored as GitHub secrets (`SMTP_USERNAME` and `SMTP_PASSWORD`).
- The recipient and sender are set to: jalarahulreddy516@gmail.com
